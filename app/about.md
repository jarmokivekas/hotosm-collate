# What is HOTOSM Collate?


HOTOSM Collate is primarily intended to help HOTOSM activation managers to keep track of the progress of Tasking Manager mapping projects during an activation by gathering their status information in a table format without much effort. It also has uses for project gardening: finding old inactive or completed projects that are still hanging around without having been archived.


For example, at the time of writing, a table of all Tasking Manager project mentioning "earthquake" that are located in Syria looks like this: 

![example screenshot of the application](screenshot1.png)

Collate is a seperate piece of software to the HOTOSM Tasking Manager, however it uses the same project data as main Tasking Manager instance tasks.hotosm.org. The data is pulled in in real-time from the Tasking manager API. Therefore if you project is on tasks.hotosm.org, it will also show up in this tool.
